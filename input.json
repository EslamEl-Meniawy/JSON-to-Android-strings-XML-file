We award Points when one of our Program Partners tells us a Member has undertaken a relevant transaction with them. (\u201cSuppliers\u201d) are companies with whom a Member can redeem BLU Points to obtain Rewards. These participating companies may change - an up to date list of Program Partners and Suppliers is available from us at any time. Program Partners determine the particular transactions on which BLU Points can be earned and the number of BLU Points to be earned. There is a set number of BLU Points needed to obtain a Reward. Each of these will change but in most cases there will be a base offer with further bonus offers that come and go. We cannot control every specific change in the participating companies or their offers but we will ensure that while BLU is in operation a range of offers is available;\r\n3.2 BLU Points are earned for purchases with any other Program Partner if a Member presents his\/her BLU Card or the Membership Number or other required information before entering into a transaction on which such other Program Partner offers BLU Points;\r\n3.3\tBLU Points cannot be redeemed until credited to a BLU Account. Program Partners will take different periods to notify us of BLU Points to be credited. We are not responsible for a failure, delay or error by a Program Partner notifying us of BLU Points to be credited;\r\n3.4\tBLU Points can be transferred to another BLU Account. The transfer will be subject to a transfer fee equivalent to 5% of the amount of the points transferred or 100 (one hundred) BLU Points, whichever is greater;\r\n3.5\tBLU Points can only be earned, held, transferred or redeemed as set out in these Member Terms. Any other use, award, sale, exchange or transfer of BLU Points, or attempt to do so, is a serious breach of these Member Terms. Any BLU Points not earned and held in accordance with these Member Terms will be invalid and cannot be redeemed for Rewards. Any such BLU Points on a BLU Account will be deducted and, if they are redeemed, we will ask the Supplier to cancel the relevant Rewards and we may take other appropriate action. BLU Points have no cash value;\r\n3.6\tA Member who continues to collect will get a regular update of the BLU Points position as we know it on the date we issue the update in respect of his\/her BLU Account including the BLU Points collected and redeemed by such Member on such BLU Account. Account information is also available from us and can be accessed on the Website or through the Mobile Application. We will correct a BLU Account if it is shown to our reasonable satisfaction to be wrong but, unless there are clear records showing this, our decision is final;\r\n3.7\tBLU reserves the right to reverse the BLU points credit issued by any partner, who discontinues operating within BLU for any reason;\r\n4\tREDEMPTION AND REWARDS\r\n4.1\tAll Rewards are subject to availability and stocks may be limited. Transactions on which BLU Points are earned or redeemed are made directly with the relevant Program Partner or Supplier and we have no responsibility for the delivery, standard, quality or otherwise of any goods and services received or supplied or the failure of a Supplier to honor a redemption or make a specific Reward available. These transactions and all Rewards are subject to all applicable legal terms and the terms and conditions (including booking requirements, cancellation restrictions, return conditions, warranties and limitations of liability) of the Program Partner or Supplier. When BLU Points are redeemed we may act as intermediary between the relevant Member and the Supplier and\/or Program Partner and we will do what we can to ensure such Rewards are supplied by the relevant Supplier and\/or Program Partner;\r\n4.2\tThe number of BLU Points required to redeem any Reward found on the Website or at a Program Partner location may change without prior notice;\r\n4.3\tAt the time of requesting the reward, Member\u2019s current BLU Points balance must be at least equal to the total BLU Points value that the Reward Member is requesting. Reward offers cannot be used in conjunction with any other Reward Supplier offers unless otherwise stated;\r\n4.4\tOnce a Reward has been delivered or picked up, it cannot be returned or exchanged for BLU Points or other Rewards;\r\n4.5\tIf a product is out of stock, BLU will suggest a replacement and it is the Member\u2019s decision to accept or refuse the replacement. Where a replacement is not taken then the BLU Points will be credited back into Member\u2019s account within 10 working days after notifying us;\r\n4.6\tIf the Reward is faulty, the Supplier\u2019s warranty will apply and the Member must revert to the Supplier for support and assistance;\r\n4.7\tSome Rewards may differ slightly from the image shown on the Website and on the Mobile Application;\r\n4.8\tRewards (excluding Coupons) which are not claimed within six months after the date of redemption, will expire if the Member is not reachable;\r\n4.9\tRewards will be delivered directly by the Supplier within ten working days;\r\n4.10\tTo redeem his\/her BLU Points in-store at Program Partners\u2019 locations, the Member must use his\/her PIN Code;\r\n5\tCOUPONS\r\n5.1\tCoupons are issued by BLU for use at the specified Supplier and for the specified Reward. They must be indicated at the time of purchase for the Reward to be delivered;\r\n5.2\tCoupons can only be used once and have a validity of 6 months and are not valid beyond the expiry date indicated on the Coupon. If the specific Reward is out of stock and Member decided not to take a replacement, the Coupon can be cancelled at any time within the 6 months validity period. If Member redeems Coupon for an item of higher value than the original specific Reward, Member may wish to pay the excess value in cash but acceptance will be up to the Program Partner\u2019s discretion. On the other hand, if Coupons are redeemed against an item of lesser value than the original specific reward, no change will be given;\r\n5.3\tCoupons cannot be exchanged for cash, sold or transferred for value. They remain the property of BLU. The Rewards redeemed with Coupons are the responsibility of the rewards provider and not BLU;\r\n5.4\tFor Coupons cancellations and refunds please contact the local BLU Call Center during working hours or send BLU an email at info@blupoints.com. A cancellation fee of 2.5% in BLU Points equivalent of the total Coupon value or 300 BLU Points, whichever is greater will be applied. BLU Points will be credited back to the members account within 10 days following receipt of the cancellation fee and returned vouchers. For Coupons purchased with BLU Points that have subsequently expired, the expired BLU Points will be forfeited and not credited back to the members account;\r\n5.5\tFor lost Coupons, Member should contact the local BLU Call Center or send an email to info@blupoints.com. Coupons will be re-issued or refunded within 10 working days;\r\n6\tOTHER REDEMPTION TERMS\r\n6.1\tBLU and\/or Supplier are not responsible for the unauthorized use of Coupons. Supplier terms and conditions also apply on the use of Coupons or on the delivery of the Reward;\r\n6.2\tWe cannot be held liable for any loss, theft, damage or unauthorized use of a BLU Card, Member\u2019s PIN Code, or Reward, whether in the course of delivery or otherwise. Any replacement of a BLU Card can be provided at the discretion of the Program Partner;\r\n6.3\tAll conditions and warranties, whether expressed or implied and whether arising under legislation or otherwise, as to the condition, suitability, quality, fitness or safety of any Reward supplied are expressly excluded to the full extent permitted by law.

In case you believe your earned BLU Points have not been credited properly to your account, you should first contact the BLU Partner where the transaction took place to clarify or adjust the inconsistency. If that does not resolve the issue, you can contact BLU directly at info@blupoints.com. Keep in mind that with some BLU Partners and participating banks, the crediting of the BLU Points is not immediate, and will take place at the end of your billing cycle (i.e. at the end of the month, or when you receive your billing statement).\r\n\r\n\r\n24\tI am not able to find the BLU Mobile App online \u2013 where is it?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BLU Mobile App is shortly on its way. BLU will notify its Members when the BLU Mobile App will become available online for download.\r\n\r\n25\tHow can I get help if I have questions that I cannot find in this FAQ?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to contact our customer care at info@blupoints.com who would gladly assist you with any query you may have.
